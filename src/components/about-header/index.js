            Hi, Iâ€™m James a highly motivated developer with a background in engineering.
            I thrive on solving problems, it is something that is second nature to me.
            Over the years I have refined this skill, along with critical thinking to solve
            and develop engineered systems from business support tools to mechanical propulsion
            systems. Typically I am very difficult to satisfy, always looking for a way of
            optimising the solution that little bit further.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph-md">
            When I first began to code everything seemed to fall into place. I became addicted
            to building and improving codebases. Drawn by the modularity of code and the
            ever-growing technological developments of tools and languages, I knew a career as
            a developer was right for me. Nothing excites me more than the thought of a future
            working with a group of ambitious, like-minded individuals striving to enhance the
            way we interact with technology and the web.
