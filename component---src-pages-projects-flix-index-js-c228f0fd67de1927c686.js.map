The first of which was building the\n          server-side REST API. This was built on NodeJS using Express to streamline the\n          build process. Because this app is a prototybe requiring limited data retirval a\n          MongoDb database was selected and easily integrated into the Express App through\n          Mongoose.\n        </p>\n      </ProjectTextBlock>\n      <ProjectImageText image={approachImage}>\n        <h3>Server Side</h3>\n        <p>\n          As this was the first server side application, to ensure a strong foundation and\n          adherence to best practices I spent a significant amount of time researching best\n          practices for structuring server side code such as Express routing, and the management\n          of controllers and services. By dividing the application into individual elements that\n          handled particular concerns such as the routes, controllers and services the application\n          became much more scalable and easy to maintain. This clean structure resulted in an easy\n          to use and highly scalable API.\n        </p>\n      </ProjectImageText>\n      <ProjectImageText image={mockupImage} reverse>\n        <h3>Client Side</h3>\n        <p>\n          The second part of the project was to build the client side user interface that interacts\n          with the API. I initially jumped straight into the project but soon discovered that this\n          led to a poor code structure which was very difficult to maintain. Early on in the project\n          I decided to restructure the code off wireframes. The result was a much slicker user\n          interface that was also much easier to maintain.\n        </p>\n      </ProjectImageText>\n      <ProjectTextBlock heading=\"The Result\">\n        <p>\n          A full-stack web application with a clean dark UI. The application features user authentication,\n          a movie list view, movie details view and a user page.\n        </p>\n      </ProjectTextBlock>\n      <ProjectImageBlock images={resultsImages} />\n    </ProjectLayout>\n  );\n};\n\nindex.propTypes = {\n};\n\nexport default index;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/flix-approach-3aeeb34efef41719281f1b0c5b203116.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/flix-mockup-4ed43d85509beb34c958fe864939bde5.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/list-view-11522c9b11ca2e78591a03834172b7ba.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/movie-view-10f0daa340701508b3f02f3315602386.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
